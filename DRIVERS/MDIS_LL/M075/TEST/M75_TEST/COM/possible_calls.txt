Receiver:
receive clock from transmitted Tx Clock (RTxC pin)
if file conf.rx is found in same directory, Rx parameters are read from it

#receive data, use signals, channel A, all param from conf.rx
m75_test -rm M75_1 -c=1 [-v]

#receive data, use signals, channel A, all param from conf.rx, output data to file
m75_test -rm M75_1 -c=1 -f=x:\target\receive.rx [-v]

#receive data, use polling, channel A, 64kBit/s, wait forever/until data is received
m75_test -r M75_1 -c=1 -b=0x71 -w=-1 [-v]

Transmitter:
if parameter -f is specified, if found Tx parameters are read from file.
parameters passed with the command line have priority.

#transmit data, data generated internally (count 0->framesize), channel A, 2MBit/s, 100 frames
m75_test M75_1 -t -c=1 -b=0x1 -n=0x64 [-v]

#transmit data, data from file, channel A, 2MBit/s, 32 frames
m75_test M75_1 -t -f=x:\target\manysmallframes.tx -c=1 -b=0x1 -n=0x20
