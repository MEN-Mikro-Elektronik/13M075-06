Receiver: (passive/responding part)
#receive data, use signals, channel A
m75_test M75_1 -c=0 -b=2 -rm [-v]

#receive data, use polling, channel A, wait forever/until data is received
m75_test M75_1 -r -c=0 -b=0x0 -w=-1 [-v]

#receive data, use polling, channel A, poll every 500ms for received data
m75_test M75_1 -r -c=0 -b=0x5 -w=500 [-v]

Transmitter: (active/initiating part)
if parameter -f is specified, if found Tx parameters are read from file.
parameters passed with the command line have priority.

#transmit data, data generated internally (count 0->framesize), channel A, 100 frames

#transmit data, data from file, channel A, 32 frames
m75_test M75_1 -t -f=x:\target\manysmallframes.tx -c=0 -b=0x1 -n=0x20
